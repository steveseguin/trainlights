To implement this using Cloudflare Workers instead of a Node.js server, I've created three artifacts:

1. A Cloudflare Worker that securely handles the LIFX API calls
2. Frontend JavaScript code that communicates with the Worker
3. A simple HTML example that demonstrates the implementation

The Cloudflare Worker approach offers several advantages:
- No need to maintain your own server
- Global CDN deployment for low latency
- Environment variables for secure API key storage
- Free tier that handles up to 100,000 requests per day

To set up the Cloudflare Worker:

1. Create a Cloudflare account if you don't have one
2. Install Wrangler CLI: `npm install -g wrangler`
3. Login: `wrangler login`
4. Create a new worker project: `wrangler init lifx-api-proxy`
5. Copy the Cloudflare Worker code into your `src/index.js`
6. Set your API token as a secret: `wrangler secret put LIFX_API_TOKEN`
7. Deploy: `wrangler publish`

Then update the frontend code with your actual Worker URL and integrate it into your train simulation website.
